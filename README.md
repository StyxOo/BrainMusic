# This is the complete record of my workings, using EMOTIV to make music
## The goal is to use an EMOTIV headset to play physical instruments

### How?
The EMOTIV headsets commands will be evaluated using node-red. Node-red will communicate with an Arduino board using a serial connection. The arduino will then proceed to manage the hardware which plays the instrument.

### Why?
To enable peolpe who are physically unable to still make music using real instruments. Because music has been an essential part of humanity since forever. And because it can be greatly beneficial for mental health. Also because it's cool.
